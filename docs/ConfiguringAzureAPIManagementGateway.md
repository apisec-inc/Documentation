## Configuring Azure API Management Gateway


From the main APIsec dashboard, click API Gateways.



Once you have done that Click "+ Register Gateway" and then select Azure API Management.


On the next screen, you will have a number of fields to fill out:
   Name (what makes sense to you), Client ID, Client Secret Key and Tenant ID.
   
   Then click "Create"
   
 *  For Enable Automatic Onboarding, it is recommended starting with this off and then turning it on after validating the registaration of a few API's.*
