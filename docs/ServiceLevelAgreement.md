## Service Levels & Maintenance


### APIsec Responsibilities

APIsec will provide and maintain the APIsec platform, and will provide access through individual user credentials. APIsec will respond to support requests within a reasonable timeframe, and take steps to escalate and resolve issues appropriately. APIsec will maintain timely communication with the customer at all times.


### Client Responsibilities

Client will notify APIsec of any issues related to the APIsec platform or service in a timely manner. Client will provide APIsec with access to software and services for the purposes of maintenance, updates, and fault prevention. The client will maintain timely communication with APIsec at all times.


### Support Response

The response time measures how long it takes APIsec to respond to a support request via email (support@APIsec.ai) or other electronic means. APIsec is deemed to have responded when it has replied to the Client’s initial request via email or other electronic means, to either provide a solution or request further information. APIsec promises to respond to support requests within twenty-four (24) business hours. 


### Resolution Times

APIsec will always endeavour to resolve problems as swiftly as possible and ensure that the platform remains accessible and free of security vulnerabilities. It recognises that the Client’s use of the System is key to its business and that any downtime can be detrimental. However, APIsec is unable to provide guarantees regarding resolution times. This is because the nature and causes of problems can vary enormously. In all cases, APIsec will make its best efforts to resolve problems as quickly as possible and provide frequent progress reports to the Client.

“Monthly Uptime” refers to the amount of time in any given month that Licensee can access the APIsec Platform, as a percentage of the total amount of time in such month, excluding Excused Outages. 

APIsec will maintain systems and controls designed to maximize Monthly Uptime, minimize unscheduled outages, minimize impact from vulnerabilities, and enable prompt notification in the event of any unscheduled outage. 


### Excused Outages

Licensee may experience outages in the APIsec Platform due to Scheduled Maintenance and/or Emergency Maintenance, as defined below (collectively “Scheduled Maintenance” and “Emergency Maintenance''). 


### Scheduled Maintenance

“Scheduled Maintenance” means planned interruptions in the APIsec product site to make changes to the systems. APIsec regularly evaluates web site traffic patterns to determine low usage times in which to perform Scheduled Maintenance. Scheduled Maintenance may include outages. The maintenance window schedule can be found on our website at: [https://docs.apisec.ai/maintenance-window/](https://docs.apisec.ai/maintenance-window/)

**Emergency Maintenance**

“Emergency Maintenance'' refers to APIsec’s efforts to correct network or security conditions that may cause service outages or severe network performance degradation impacting multiple customers and requiring immediate action. Emergency Maintenance may degrade the quality of service, including possible outages. APIsec’s policy is to notify Licensee with as much advance notice as possible under the circumstance before performing the Emergency Maintenance.
