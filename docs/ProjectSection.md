The APIsec Home page has a Project section below the Services tiles. Once you Register an API, a Project is created and added in this section. The name of the Project is same as the API name you enter while registering the API.

This section has two views. i.e, Grid and List view. You can select the one that works best for you. 

`click` on the buttons above Project tile to switch the view. 

Another useful feature is the 'Search' bar. User can search for the desired Project by the Project name. 
You can also switch between 'My Projects' or 'All Projects' with the toggle besides the search bar. 

- 'My Projects' only show the Projects created by the current user. 
- 'All Projects' are restricted to admins only
