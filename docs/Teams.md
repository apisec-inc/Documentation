#  Teams

The Teams screen is used to create and manage teams of users. The purpose of this is to enable easier management of access to projects for teams of users.  
Instead of adding a user one at a time as collaborator at projects, if a user is part of team that is assigned to an API group, they automatically will receive
Project Collaborator access to the API Projects that are members of the group.
