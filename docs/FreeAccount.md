A user can sign up a free account on APIsec. But, free accounts always allow limited features to the users, same is the case with APIsec. 

However, a user can get unrestricted access by purchasing the APIsec Standard ,Professional or Enterprise license. More details can be found on the official website www.apisec.ai .

To sign up a free account; `click` on 'Sign up now' at very bottom of the APIsec Login form. 

Once at the sign up form, enter all the credentials and `click` 'Signup'. If everything is correct then a free account will be successfully registered. Also, the user will be redirected to the login form.

The free account's user home page does not has 'Security Categories' tile in the services menu. It restricts the users from 'Intergrations' and  'Reports' on a "Project Dashboard'. Moreover, the free user can only register 2 API's.
