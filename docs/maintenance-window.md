# Maintenance Window

APIsec is committed to a continuous delivery cycle and as such will have a nightly maintenance window.
The following tasks are executed during the maintenance windows:
- Application and scanner deployments
- UX, bug fixes, enhancements, and new feature deployments
- Configuration changes related to security and usability are applied

Service status during the maintenance windows:
- All updates are triggered automatically and/or done by the APIsec staff
- All updates are applied as rolling updates resulting in zero to a few mins of service being not accessible.
- All changes pre and post-deployments are automatically tested by our continuous test automation suite if deemed unfit automatic rollbacks are triggered.
- If you see service issues during the maintenance window, please try again after the window time.

## Maintenance Window Times

APIsec currently is using the following maintenance times:
- Monday - Saturday: 2:30 am PST until 3 am PST
