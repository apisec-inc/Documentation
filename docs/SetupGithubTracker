This document outlines the steps to setup your Atlassian Jira account with APIsec.  

### **Setup Github Issue Tracker**

The expectation is that you already have an account with Github or know how to set one up.  You can find more information how to set up Personal Access Token <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">here</a>.

1. From the homepage select your project > Then, select the `Configurations` tab.
2. Select the `Integrations` tab from the top menu.
3. From the left menu select `Issue Tracker`.
4. Choose an Environment Name Profile.
5. Select `Github` for the Issue Tracker.
6. Create New Issue Tracker Credentials by clicking on the button.  Or, select from the Credentials dropdown if it's already created. You can create a new user with read/write access to the test repository.

   Note: You'll need the your email and and API token to add your JIRA account (more info on the popup).
   
   
   
7. Once you add the credentials, add the Issue-Tracker URL.

The following fields are optional:

9. Assignee Username.  The gtHub username of the assignee must be a collaborator with write access.

Activating the toggle button will log the vulnerabilities to Jira.

Finally, click on `Test Credentials` button to validate the connection has established and click Save.

If everything is setup correctly, you'll see Valid Credentials message at the bottom of the screen.
