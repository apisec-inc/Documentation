The APIsec platform helps you integrate with wide range of applications that connect with your API Gateway.  
Let's start by registering the Postman APIs.  

First, add your Postman credentials as described in <a href="https://apisec-inc.github.io/documentation/Vault/">chapter 8</a>, Vault section.  
**Note:** In the dropdown menu, the Postman option will be under the API Gateway section.

Once you have your credentials setup, from the homepage, click on the API Gateway.
Look for the Postman setup with the name you have created above. Click on that and your APIs from Postman should be listed.

During this proces, the APIsec will be writing the customized validations for the APIs (this step may take a few minutes to complete).  You'll be redirected to the homepage.
