The APIsec platform helps you integrate with wide range of applications that connect with your API Gateway.  
Let's start by registering the Postman APIs.  

First, add your Postman credentials as described in the <a href="[url](https://docs.apisec.ai/Vault/)">Vault</a> section.  The Postman option will be under the API Gateway.

Once you have your credentials setup, from the homepage, click on the API Gate.  
Look for the Postman setup with the name you have created above. Click on that and your APIs from Postman should be listed.
Register those APIs and you'll be redirected to the homepage.  
During this proces, the APIsec will be writing the customized validations for the APIs (this step may take a few minutes to complete) 
Then you can start with your first scan.
