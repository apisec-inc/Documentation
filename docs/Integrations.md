APIsec allows you to integrate a number of platforms with the Project. These integrations provide cross-platform connectivity and automate the processes. 

### **5.1. Reports Storage**
User can export reports to AWSS3, GCP, and Azure cloud accounts. The reports are sent automatically at the beginning of every month. 

If the credentials for the Report Storage account already stored in the vault can be used or the user can add new credentials. The process of adding the new credentials is already explained in Chapter 6.

### **5.2. Issue Tracker**
The APIsec automates the process of vulnerability life-cycle management by providing option to integrate issue tracking platforms like Trello, GitHub, Jira, etc.

A user has to chose the Profile and the Issue Tracker. 
I choose 'APIsec Issues'. All the vulnerabilities will be logged in the APIsec Project Dashboard.
