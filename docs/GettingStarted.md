### **3. Update your API in Projects**
    
    You now have an API project to work with.
    1. Click on your new project tile to work with it.
    2. You will land on the API Project Dashboard. It wont have much to see yet.
    3. Go to "Configurations". This is optional but good to know for later.
        - If you know some credentials and variables you want to include, you can import them or set them up now.
        - If not, you can skip this for now. There are default ones provided to edit and replace.
    4. Go to "Playbooks". It may take a few minutes for the playbooks to populate, 
    you need to wait for this before performing a scan.

### **4. Run a scan**
    
    1. Go back to the Dashboard by clicking on the API Project name.
    2. Select your Security Categories. If you want OWASP Top 10, you can Select all, 
        - then remove the few that say "Top 25" at the end.
    3. Click "Submit"
    Your scan is running!

### **6. What's next?**
    There's a lot more you can do, but you now have the basics working. Here are some features to explore:
    - Verify scan results.
    - Rescan after changes.
    - Update credentials and variables.
    - Integrate to ticket, notification and CI/CD systems.
    - Make scan summary reports a part of your regular security practices.
