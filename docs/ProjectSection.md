The APIsec Home page has a Project section below the Services tiles. Once you Register an API, a Project is created and added in this section. The name of the Project is same as the API name you enter while registering the API.

This section has two views. i.e, Grid and List view. You can toggle to any of the one as per your requirement.

`click` on the buttons above Project tile to switch the view. 

Another useful feature is the 'Search' bar. User can search for the desired Project by the Project name. 
Moreover, User can switch between 'My Projects' or 'All Projects' by hitting the toggle besides the search bar. 

- 'My Projects' only show the Projects created by the current user. 
- Only admins can see/view 'All Projects'.
