# Maintenance Window

APIsec is committed to a continuous delivery cycle and as such will have a nightly maintenance window.
The following tasks are executed during the maintenance windows:

- Application and scanner deployments.
- UX, bug fixes, enhancements, and new feature deployments,
- Configuration changes related to security and usability are applied.

Service status during the maintenance windows:

- All updates are triggered automatically and/or done by the APIsec staff.
- All updates are applied as rolling updates resulting in minimal downtime, if any. 
- All changes pre and post-deployments are automatically tested by our continuous test automation suite.  If we determine any deficiences, an automatic rollback is triggered.
- If you experience service issues during the maintenance window, please wait a few minutes and try again.
