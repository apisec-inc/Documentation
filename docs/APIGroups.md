#  API Groups

API Groups are a way to bundle together API projects into a group that is appropriate for your organization. In this first version, the use of API groups is for managing collaborators. on projects without having to do this one at a time.

In order to create a group, click the New API group button and then give a Group Name and Description. Utilize the button on the right to select the API's that should be part of this group.  You are then able to either add a list of teams that should have Collaborator access to the API projects that are part of the group - or leave this entry blank to be filled in later.
